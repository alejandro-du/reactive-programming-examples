Learn about Reactive Programming in Java (watch the [webinar](https://go.mariadb.com/22Q2-WBN-GLBL-OSSG-DEV-Reactive-Programming-2022-02-24_Registration-LP.html)):

 - Start with [reactive-programming](/reactive-programming) and see how **one thread** can successfully **serve 10 
   users**.
 - Take a look at [blocking-service](/blocking-service) to see a typical REST web service with **JDBC** connections.
 - See how to use the `Flux` class and [R2DBC](https://r2dbc.io/) to build a **fully reactive** service.
 - **Compare throughput** using [Artillery](https://www.artillery.io/). See how many HTTP 200 OK responses you get on 
   each service (test scripts included on each service project).
